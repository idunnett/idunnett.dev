Since computers started advancing with the likes of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the idea of possibly creating a machine which could generate human-like **moral**, **cultural**, and **aesthetic** experiences became increasingly popular. As further discoveries about the human brain became known and further advancements in the engineering of computers were being made, it seemed as if the two were slowly starting to merge closer. After all, they both use electricity, take in inputs, perform computations on the inputs, and produce an output, right? In Giorgio Innocenti’s _Neural Computing: The metaphorical, cultural roots of brain models_, he argues that the contemporary computer is nothing like the human brain, and that the margin of difference between the two are so large that this idea may never become a reality. After further investing myself in the topic, I believe Innocenti to be correct in that the brain is far too complex to even come close to replicating even for the far future of technology. Within this article, I will be providing the differences between contemporary computers and the human brain according to Innocenti along with my reasoning for why I believe his analysis to be true.

The first topic that Innocenti presents is that the way the brain works is dependent on the body that it belongs to and the environment that it has grown accustomed to (Innocenti, 2013). He points out as an example, that animals’ brains and the way they think become optimized for survival and reproduction based on the environment they are in. This cannot be done without the brain being aware of its body to be able to distinguish predators/prays among other animals etc. (Innocenti, 2013). Right off the bat we can see the clear major difference in complexity between the computer and the brain pertaining to just this difference alone. For a computer to try and reach similar functionality, we would first need to create our own version of the human nervous system for whatever object the computer resides within and then create software for it to recognize its nervous system and the environment it is in to optimize its processing for what it sees beneficial.

Innocenti goes on to state that unlike computers, “the operations performed by the brain are the result of its internal structure that is, of the properties of the elements which constitute the brain, the neurons, and of the ways these elements are interconnected” (Innocenti, 2013, p. 69). Computers use stored data to discern how it should perform different operations, but the brain’s operations are determined by its internal physical structure involving each element within it. This gives us a better realization of just how complex the brain is. Each element within the brain is unique to all other elements, each element performs its own computations, each element is interconnected to a network “beyond imagination” that uses “massively parallel processing lines”, and each operation stores its own memory elements (Innocenti, 2013).

Lastly, Innocenti poses that the brain is self-organizing/self-repairing (Innocenti, 2013). In other words, computers are created by an external third party (humans), however, the structure of the brain is put together at birth and adjusts with age without any external help. In addition, he points out that “brains perform effortlessly operations that the fastest computers cannot match” (Innocenti, 2013, p. 71). This could involve tasks such as making decisions – a computer does not possess its own preferences. To follow this, Innocenti also mentions the controversial topic of the brain’s capability of free decision making (Innocenti, 2013). Something that we know for certain computers do not possess.

Since the brain has such a high level of functional complexity along with the extreme amount of uniquely specific elements pertaining to the brain, it is hard to believe that one day the functions of the brain could be replicated. Even the smartest scientists still do not entirely know how parts of the brain function to this day. In fact, I partly believe that the brain is too complicated for humans to ever be able to understand as it was formed not by humans. Therefore, at a certain point, another question we may need to start asking is “how could something of this level of complexity been created and where did it come from?”. We must ask this question as even the brain of an insect has such deep complexity. However, if it were in fact possible to replicate the brain, I believe the entire concept of our computing machines would need to be rethought and made in an entirely new way that is more similar to what we currently know about the human brain.

From looking at the differences of the contemporary computer and the human brain according to Innocenti, we can see just how much the two vary in function, structure, and ability. The fact that the brain sends millions of inputs through an unimaginably vast network of unique and mutable internal elements to form just one single operation makes this idea of trying to replicate its functions sound completely unattainable with our knowledge of technology now, and in the far foreseeable future.
