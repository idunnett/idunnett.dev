IBM has been known as one of the largest tech companies in the world for some time, but it wasn’t solely their technological innovations that made them into a booming tech empire. One of the biggest factors in IBM’s story was their unique corporate culture. This type of corporate culture may come with a negative perspective on change and invoke a sense of conformity and competition amongst employers. Nevertheless, it is clearly still a major factor in the company’s growth. This essay argues that IBM’s corporate culture was incredibly powerful as seen from the company’s enormous success and achievements, however, there exists various drawbacks seen throughout history when examining the story of William Murrell.

When IBM was young, Thomas J. Watson (CEO) formed their corporate culture into one with a family atmosphere, moral education, high pay, and benefits, and was anti-union/anti-labour organizing (Wright, 2021, lec. 6, p. 24). The company also sang rally songs to honor Watson and IBM, and they had a slogan that read “THINK” to encourage innovation. This corporate culture was attractive to many, and the company grew quickly. However, the company was certainly not perfect, and many flaws existed. One of them being discrimination against minority groups. Four years after the Civil Rights Act in 1964, according to the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), IBM was one of the fifty-six large companies with no (or insignificant number of) employees that were Black or Puerto Rican (McIlwain, 2021, p. 33). The EEOC called for these companies to address this issue and explain how they will improve their efforts. In the end, IBM was the only company that did not attend the hearing in person but rather provided a report that “remained silent about how many blacks IBM employed.” (McIlwain, p. 34). In addition to this, the company still had its underhandedly ways of trying to minimize their employees of minority groups by creating a “Programmer Aptitude Test” and including overly detailed job descriptions to make their jobs seem too difficult (McIlwain, p. 34). I believe that it was because of this prideful, family-atmosphere corporate culture, that IBM was not as susceptible to change as most companies.

Despite IBM’s struggles with discrimination in the early 1960’s, the company did try to improve, and the result of hiring minorities proved to be incredibly beneficial. The company started making efforts to fix their issues by organizing programs that “reported, had graduated 528 women and men since 1965. Of these, 211 of were black.” (McIlwain, 2021, p. 37). In the late 1960’s the company really started to see the impact from this, as they were exponentially growing, and their revenues doubled from 3.5 to 7 billion dollars (McIlwain, p. 37). While IBM’s issues with discrimination were still far from resolved, things were starting to head in the right direction as Charlton McIlwain states, “Tom Watson Jr., had agreed with Bobby Kennedy that the company could meet its demand for technical and manufacturing labor and fight black poverty simultaneously.” (McIlwain, p. 37). And by 1979, the company’s most successful branches were running primarily by minority groups and Watson goes on to say that it “demonstrated that investing in minority employees and communities could create real business advantages for IBM and its shareholders” (McIlwain, p. 38). This goes to show that this corporate culture is one that is clearly powerful, and with the right motives, it can, and will thrive.

Throughout William Murrell’s experience at IBM, he did not encounter as many issues with discrimination like he had with previous employers. But rather, William saw issues with conformity, and competition at IBM. William states “the company said that it despised conformity and groupthink. But William discovered that IBM had its own way of doing things. And it expected its customer engineers to do it IBM’s way, not whatever William’s way might be at any particular time.” (McIlwain, 2021, p. 42). He saw this conformity with the decision tree that he had to use in training and the fact that he was the only one without a clean-shaven face and he felt like he could not wear anything but a matched suit (McIlwain, p. 42). He goes on to say that “believing anything the boss told you was expected.” (McIlwain, p.42) and “A lot of fake conversations happened in this office environment.” (McIlwain, p. 43). This corporate culture’s conformity, along with everyone competing for the next rank, prioritizes procedures over people and real relationships and it discourages people from having their own thoughts and innovations.

In the end, there may never exist the perfect corporate culture as every employee is different. Despite William Murrell’s experience at IBM, the company gave him countless skills that he could put to work for himself (McIlwain, 2021, p. 43). IBM’s corporate culture certainly had some major flaws as seen through its history with discrimination and through some of the experiences that William Murrell had, however, it is still a culture that has proved to work as we can see with IBM today.
