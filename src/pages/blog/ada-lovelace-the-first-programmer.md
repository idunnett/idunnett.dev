The definition of the term ‘computer programmer’ widely follows along the lines of “a person who designs/writes/tests programs for computers”, but at what point can this title be assigned to history when people did not know what a computer is? This essay argues that Ada Lovelace can rightfully be considered the world’s first computer programmer in history as she was the first to see the potential that computers could have. Ada Lovelace fit the definition of a computer programmer by designing a program for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. Although it was a theoretical design, her discoveries and visions sparked the concept of computer programs.

Modern day computers have drastically improved since Lovelace, from almost no computability to trillions of operations per second. However, the definition of a computer programmer remains the same. After communicating with Babbage and drawing inspiration from his Analytical Engine, Ada had translated a mathematical computation into a set of instructions designed to be done by a machine and as she stated in one of her letters to him: “without having been worked out by human head & hands first” (Lovelace, 1843). An action of this nature nowadays is referred to as ‘computer programming’ by definition (Wright, 2021, p. 27).

Haigh and Priestly like to take a different stance on this matter, implying that Lovelace could not have been the first computer programmer for a few reasons. The writers debate this by explaining that Lovelace used Babbage’s machine as a basis, which had little influence on the design of the first officially named computer that we all know and love today (Haigh and Priestly, 2015, pg. 4, para. 1). They further emphasize on Cohen’s words who quotes Grace Hopper “who worked closely with Aiken to oversee programming of his computer, as saying she was unaware of Lovelace’s work ‘until 10 or 15 years later.’” (Haigh and Priestly, pg. 4, para. 2). Aiken was seen to be biased against Babbage and his work in his proposal for the Harvard Mark 1 (Haigh and Priestly, pg. 4, para. 2), thus explaining Lovelace’s absence to Hopper. However, Aiken knew of Lovelace and her discoveries and therefore he knew of the potential for machines. Haigh and Priestly go even further in questioning if Lovelace served only as a contributor for Charles Babbage’s project and if she should even be seen in the category of genius (Haigh and Priestly, pg. 3, para. 4). While this statement may be a tad bold, besides what they argue, nothing can take away the fact that Lovelace was the first to realize the possibility for a machine to complete a series of instructions to achieve tasks without the help of humans.

One of the largest factors that makes Lovelace stand out among the crowd and helped her achieve her success was her enormous ability to see the potential of what machines could possibly achieve one day. Haigh and Priestly point out that she imagined machines that could be able to compose pieces of music (Haigh and Priestly, 2015, pg. 3, para. 3). These radical thoughts would never have existed if it were not for Lovelace, and because of her, these concepts of computer programming started to circulate the world. Therefore, even if she had never created the program for the Bernoulli example, she still had the vision and intellect to introduce the ideas of computer programming. In addition to this, the fact that she was able to picture these possibilities all while during the 1800’s from Charles Babbage’s zero-electricity machine, speaks volumes to Lovelace’s ability and that definitely deserves accreditation.

Ada Lovelace’s monumental accomplishments and visionary introduced the concept of computer programming which shaped the way we see computers. She fits the definition of a computer programmer and despite never seeing her program to calculate Bernoulli numbers perform in-action, her incredible drive and ambition built the foundation of computer programming for the world. Thus, Ada Lovelace has, without a doubt, proved to be considered history’s first computer programmer.
