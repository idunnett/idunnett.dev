Recently, Facebook announced that it would be developing a version of Instagram that would be designed for children ages thirteen and under. However, it received an enormous amount of criticism and pushback resulting in Facebook delaying this idea. I would like to join that pushback as I argue that children should absolutely not be on social media given its ramifications. I believe that it is unethical to design and run a social media platform for children so young. Throughout this paper, I will be applying some ethical theories such as **Deontology**, **Utilitarianism**, and **Situational Ethics** to see how this idea might stray from being ethical, and I will also be mentioning some of my personal opinions.

The first ethical theory I would like to look at is Deontology, which states that we must treat people not merely as a means to an end, but as an end in themselves. On September 14th, 2021, The Wall Street Journal published an article informing us that it has been confirmed that Facebook **knows** the harm that it is inflicting on its users and more specifically, that Instagram has led to increased rates of mental health issues in teenage girls, such as depression, anxiety, self-confidence, body image, and suicidal thoughts (Emba, 2021, p. 1). Despite being aware of this, Facebook prioritizes its profits over ethical decision making, as every single user, no matter the age, contributes towards the company’s revenue stream. Now, instead of attempting to fix Instagram’s enormous problems that already exist, the company decided to look at attracting more children to their platforms. This could be problematic as Adam Satariano and Ryan Mac state that, “policymakers, regulators, child safety groups and consumer rights groups have argued that it hooks children on the app at a younger age rather than protecting them from problems with the service, including child predatory grooming, bullying and body shaming.” (Satariano & Mac, 2021, p. 2). I believe that Facebook’s new idea was entirely created for monetary gains despite the claim that they are helping children. They are not truly caring about the health and well-being of the children of our society, and that goes against the ethical theory of Deontology.

Utilitarianism is the second ethical theory that I would like to apply to this idea of a social media for children. In other words, is Facebook doing what is best for the greater good? Is this idea the option that gives happiness to the greatest amount of people? Our generation has never had so much information and content at our fingertips. We feel pressure to share content that falsely advertises our lives and claims that we have everything all-together. In an article written by Annie Palmer, she includes a survey that was taken in 2018 to determine if people think they could easily quit social media. The survey showed that 59% of people think that they could (Palmer, 2018, p. 1). Well then why don’t they, you might ask? It is because these platforms are extremely addictive, and it is not as easy to quit as people might think. Just like smoking and tobacco companies, Christine Emba states that “it’s understood that it was a bad idea to wait until lung cancer was a full-blown problem to begin limiting those companies’ growth. For the sake of children and adults, they should have been blocked, shrunk or otherwise regulated down in size as soon as we had hints about the dire consequences of using their products.” (Emba, 2021, p. 2). Comparatively, many individuals may only want to quit social media once it has ruined their mental health or has even begun to inflict suicidal thoughts, and at that point, it may be too late.

If I look back at my childhood, perhaps at old home videos, there does not exist a time when I was seen with any type of electronic device in my hand let alone a social media platform that would harm my mental health. I was always playing with friends or spending time with my family, often outside when the nearest electronic device was the landline or television. Today, I may catch myself saying “oh to be a kid again” referring to when there was little or no anxiety, stress, and depression. As a kid I did not have anything to prove, and I had not yet been introduced to social media. Why on earth would we want to encourage something for kids that has proven to be harmful to their mental health? I believe the more people who fall victim to addictive social media use, leads to a humanity deprived of true happiness. Introducing it at an earlier age is just exacerbating the problem, and therefore goes against the ethical theory of Utilitarianism.

The third and final ethical theory that I would like to apply to Facebook’s idea is one that opens the possibility to pose a contrary argument to mine. This is the theory of Situational Ethics. Situational Ethics implies that we must make the best judgments based on the situation that we are in along with its circumstances. A common argument (Facebook included) that can follow this theory is to argue that, today, it is inevitable that children will go on social media, and therefore, it would be advantageous to create a social media for kids in order to lessen their exposure to non-child-friendly content. When taking this standpoint, right away we can see the advantages that this may have as Satariano and Mac mention a report that showed “children as young as 13 were targeted within 24 hours of creating an account with harmful content, including material related to eating disorders, extreme diets, sexualized imagery, body shaming, self-harm and suicide.” (Satariano & Mac, 2021, p. 2).

Almost everything checks out with this standpoint except for one thing. It is not inevitable that all children thirteen and under will use social media. Not every one of these children are using Instagram today. With more awareness of mental health, parents are more inclined to educate their children on the dangers of social media. I believe the biggest thing that _Instagram Kids_ would do, is give these children even more of an incentive to start using social media. This would cause them to get addicted earlier and then inevitably move on to the original version of Instagram when they get older, or when they have worn out their interest in the children’s version. We know that it is impossible to prevent kids from finding their way to social media platforms, just as in the same way teenagers will always find a way to get their hands on alcohol before having reached the legal age. However, if it is labelled as restricted, the number of kids using it **will** decrease, and that is a success. Enforcing measures to discourage social media access to children may postpone a child’s introduction to social media, which in turn, may one day save their lives.

Due to the backlash that Instagram Kids has received, we can see that it is not just a small percentage of people that realize this idea is unethical, and a strong desire to fix issues with social media has been sparked. At a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing, lawmakers stated that “simply pausing Instagram Kids was insufficient” (Satariano & Mac, 2021, p. 2) implying that changes need to be made and we cannot continue to allow social media companies like Facebook to negatively impact the well-being and mental health of so many. From applying Deontology, Utilitarianism and Situational Ethics, I believe that Facebook’s idea of a social media platform for children is unethical.
